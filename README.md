# Yondu Technical Exam

A technical exam from Yondu. 

## Instructions

Build an app that contains a search box where a user can start typing a title of a book and the app will retrieve in real-time the RSS Feeds and perform the search for a book with a title that matches the query. We are assuming that the data in these feeds will change continuously so it's not possible to cache them.

## Requirements

* Search results will need to show image, title, publication date and rating of each result, only for the books that have rating above 4.5 stars.
* If no books are found with 4.5 stars, show books with 4 stars.
